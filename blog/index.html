  <h2>1. On-demand Transferring</h2>

<p>The booting process of a VM requires only a small part of the image data.
We test the bootstrap process of popular operating systems, including
Windows and various Linux distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE,
and CentOS. We record the data access traces, including the address and
the request time of the data blocks. The following figure shows the result.</p>

<p><img src="/images/img-differentos.png" width="450"></p>

<p>The test shows that, only a few hundreds MBs of data is required for
booting, whereas the whole image is at least GBs big. Most of the data
is not used during the booting process, and some of data is nevever
used during the whole life time of the VM instance. So on-demand
transferring will reduce a lot of data transferring need, escpecially
in the booting process.</p>

<h2>2. Caching</h2>

<p>Data blocks should be cached on compute nodes so that they can be reused
later, if the instance is rebooted or new instances of the image are
created.</p>

<h2>3. P2P Transferring</h2>

<p>The data set required to boot each VM instance of the same origin image
is quite similar to one another. So data received by a compute node can
be forwarded to another, in order to reduce pressure of image server(s),
and to improve efficiency. P2P transferring allows image service capacity
to scale up accordingly with the number of clients (compute nodes).</p>

<p><img src="/images/img-tree.png" width="450"></p>

<h2>4. Prefetching</h2>

<p>The sequence of data blocks required to boot each VM instance of the
same origin image is quite similar to one another, too. And the sequence
is likely to stay preserved when the instance is rebooted. So we record
the sequence of each image, and use it as a predict to prefetch data
for the booting process.</p>

<h1>VMThunder: Fast Provisioning of Large-Scale Virtual Machine Clusters</h1>

<p><strong>Zhaoning Zhang, Ziyang Li, Kui Wu, Dongsheng Li, Huiba Li, Yuxing Peng, Xicheng Lu</strong></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) allows users to rent
resources from cloud to meet their various computing
requirements. The pay-as-you-use model, however, poses a
non-trivial technical challenge to the IaaS cloud service
providers: how to fast provision a large number of virtual
machines (VMs) to meet users&#8217; dynamic computing requests?
We address this challenge with VMThunder, a new VM
provisioning tool, which downloads data blocks on demand
during the VM booting process and speeds up VM image
streaming by strategically integrating peer-to-peer (P2P)
streaming techniques with enhanced optimization schemes
such as transfer on demand (ToD), cache on read (CoR),
snapshot on local (SoL), and relay on cache (RoC). In
particular, VMThunder stores the original images in a
share storage and in the meantime it adopts a tree-based
P2P streaming scheme so that common image blocks are
cached and re-used across the nodes in the cluster. We
implement VMThunder in CentOS Linux and thoroughly test
its performance. Comprehensive experimental results show
that VMThunder outperforms the state-of-the-art VM
provisioning methods, with respect to scalability,
latency, and VM runtime I/O performance.</p>

  <p>The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud has become
increasingly important due to its flexible pay-as-you-go business
model. Over the IaaS cloud, customers
can rent computing and storage resources
according to their actual service requirement, and thus
they can save a great deal of cost without the need to
invest on computing infrastructure. The convenience
for customers, however, poses a challenging problem
to IaaS cloud providers: how to accommodate dynamic
computing requirements of customers, who may
request a large quantity of virtual machines (VMs) in
a short time period?</p>

<p>It has been seen that in large-scale IaaS cloud
like the National Supercomputing Center of China
in Tianjin (NSCC-Tianjin), some users require
resources (virtual CPU, memory, disk space) for
compute-intensive applications, including, for example,
animation, DNA sequence analysis, and weather
forecast. In many cases, they may submit requests
for hundreds of VMs and they need the cloud to
respond to their requests quickly. Once their services
finish, they normally release VMs to save cost. The
similar phenomenon has been observed in other commercial
IaaS cloud such as Amazon EC2.
For an IaaS cloud service provider, a large delay in
VM provisioning (e.g., hours) may turn its customers
away to its competitors, and it is thus critical to
support fast provisioning of a large amount of VMs
to maintain its market competence.</p>

<p>Substantial efforts have been devoted to fast provisioning
of a large number of VMs. Nevertheless,
existing solutions still have large room for further
improvement. For example, the time for provisioning
VMs over Amazon EC2 is still non trivial, taking from
3 minutes up to 30 minutes to get a 1 GB compressed
VM image ready to work. Wartel et al. use
the peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to disseminate VM
images, and it takes about 30 minutes to configure 400
servers. Some work focuses on the problem
of optimal image placement. Based on the analysis
of empirical usage of VM images, they split
the images into small strips over the distributed file
system for efficient access and storage. This method,
however, needs a long time to pre-process the image
files. Another type of solutions uses the so-termed
&ldquo;memory fork&rdquo; method (e.g., SnowFlock and Twinkle),
which remotely clones VMs by duplicating
the running states of the VM. Memory fork, however,
may cause new problems such as data persistence.</p>

<p>Though the transferring process can be eliminated by using network
storage like NFS, cluster FS, distributed FS or SAN, this approach
lacks scalability due to the limited number of replica for each piece
of data. Booting a large number of virtual machines will direct a
large number of servers to access the same set of data at the same
time, which will generate great pressure on the storage servers.
What&rsquo;s more, network storage tends to provide less I/O performance
at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>VMThunder pushes the state of the art of largescale VM provisioning,
by integrating on-demand transferring, compute node (client-side)
caching, P2P transfering and prefetching. The protocol for data
transferring is iSCSI, but technically compatible with other
protocols like nbd, FCoE or AoE. Caching is realized with Facebook&rsquo;s
flashcache module, but technically compatible with other block-level
caching modules like bcache, dm-cache, etc.</p>

  <p>Creating a large number of virtual machine instances in an IaaS
cloud can be quite time-consuming, because the virtual disk
images need to be transferred to the compute nodes in prior to
booting.</p>

<p>VMThunder addresses this problem by following improvements: compute node
caching, P2P transfering and prefetching, in addition to on-demand
transfering (network storage). VMThunder is a scalable and cost-effective
accelerator for bulk povisioning of virtual machines. And it can
be, if preferred, gracefully turned off after the booting process is
complete.</p>

<p>Benchmarks show that VMThunder can boot 160 VMs (CentOS 6.2 with
gnome desktop) on 160 compute nodes with in a minute, and
the average time consumption is 20 seconds. With prefetching, the
complete and average time consumption can be respecttively reduced
to 18 and 16 seconds. The network is Gigabit Ethernet for all
servers in the benchmark environment.</p>

<p>VMThunder can greatly improves the <strong><em>elasticity</em></strong> of a cloud system,
which is considered as a major advantage over traditional system.
VMThunder is feasible for VM cluster of any <strong><em>scale</em></strong>, no matter
large or small. VMThunder is independent of and transparent to VMM.
That means <strong><em>any</em></strong> VMM can be supported, such as VMM, Xen, Virtual BOX,
VMWare etc.</p>
